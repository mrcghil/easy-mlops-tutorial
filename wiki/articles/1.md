## Basic Tuning Strategies

### Manual

Up to the Data Scientist to define the parameters to modify.

### Grid Search

Test 

### Random Search

Unlike grid search, a random search is not deterministic. This means that the parameters to try are sampled from a distribution. 

## More Advanced Strategies

### Model-based Search

We can create a meta-problem where we look for the optimal performance over the test set and determine the hyperparameters by using gradient-based approaches.
