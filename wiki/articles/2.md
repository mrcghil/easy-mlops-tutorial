## Problem

This project poses the problem of finding the best possible price for an item at a certain point in time.

## Data

The data we are using is synthetic data created with a simple world model:

- Price influences the propensity to buy.
- The poupularity of the product has a non-linear trend over time.
- The propensity to buy of the individuals changes at different times of day.

## Objective

Knowing only the time of day, markup/markdown applied, and if a product was sold or not, determine the best possible price delta to apply for a product at any given time.

## Modelling Decisions

Even though we know that the time of day has an impact on the propensity to buy and that there is a trend over time, the first version of the model will not explicitly make use of this information.

This is sometimes done when there is not enough past data or if we are highly uncertain that past trends might continue as they are.

The time dimension will be accounted for by the model using the MLOps loop.

## Task A

Implement a simple grid search hyperparameter tuning algorithm.

## Task B

Close the ML loop with data coming from the live experiments.
