## Data Drifts

The synthetic data contains two types of time drifts:

- Intraday
- Slow drift

This means that the characteristics of the distributions in the data can change over time.

We need to decide what to do:

1) Do we want to build a simple model and retrain it periodically?
2) Do we want to build a model that also treats time as a feature?
3) Mixed approach (retrain for slow drift, model intraday changes)?

The right answer depends on the problem. 

In this case, number we will take the approach (1).

## Objective

Make sure the model recommendations do not get less accurate over time.

## Task

Use the data from the experiments to decide when the accuracy becomes too low.
